# Dealing with a Sudden Drop in Website Traffic

A sudden drop in website traffic can be a nightmare to experience. If you don’t know what’s happening, you’re left with only your imagination to fill in the blanks.

Let’s cut to the chase and answer the biggest question first: yes, there’s a chance your traffic will come back without you having to do anything.

But there’s also a strong chance that it will only partially return.

Even if you believe your content quality is better than everyone else, other forces may impact Google’s decision to strip you of rankings.

## Recent Changes and Challenges

The most recent “Helpful Content” algorithm update (released September 2023) has led to an eruption of posts on Reddit crying out for help from huge drops in traffic. If you’re one of those folks and are now scouting the web for hints, I can hopefully give you some suggestions on how to turn the ship around.

If, after reading this article, you still feel like you have no idea what’s wrong, then shoot me through a contact form submission, and I’ll do a free audit on your site to see if I can help you figure it out.

## Why Did My Traffic Tank?

There are countless reasons you might have experienced a sudden drop in traffic. Some are within your control, and some aren’t. Here are the issues we see most commonly:

### Major Google Algorithm Update

This usually happens when your site suddenly loses traffic, and you haven’t changed anything.

Google likes to fiddle with their codebase. It’s a necessary evil, especially with the volume of AI-generated content flooding the web right now.

### Your Content Isn’t That Useful

This is a hard pill to swallow, but sometimes your content isn’t as high quality as you think.

### You’ve Done Something Silly

Have you tried to purchase backlinks or create a bunch of pages specifically to improve your site’s rankings without considering if it will be a good experience for your users?

### Changes to Your Website’s Setup

If your drop in rankings came after you made changes to your website, then you’re probably in luck because these changes can often be remedied.

### New Competitors

If a competing business has turned its attention to your keyword profile, then it may be trying to steal your traffic.

### Seasonality and Market Conditions

Selling winter jackets during a heatwave? Or maybe your product has been replaced by some new AI tool. Sometimes your traffic has dropped because people aren’t searching for the things you’re writing on.

## What Can I Do to Figure It Out?

Some of these reasons are outside of your control. In those situations, the best advice we can give is to monitor your site’s performance and keep an eye on what your competitors are up to.

There are some factors you can control, but you’ll need to be able to keep an eye on them to know if they’re causing a problem. These factors are content changes, website structure changes, SEO changes, and technical performance/accessibility.

In this section, we’ll go through each of these factors, explain what they are, and how you can measure them.

SEO performance is how well your website is ranking in search engine results. Monitoring it is relatively straightforward.

### Technical Performance

Technical performance is largely determined by how fast your website is loading. Slow websites are a significant problem.
