Congratulations! You now have a basic Next.js project up and running.

### _5.2 Creating a Shopify Headless CMS Account_

2. Once you're logged in, navigate to the "Apps" section in your Shopify admin dashboard.

3. In the "Apps" section, click on "Manage private apps" and then "Create a new private app".

4. Fill in the required information for your private app, such as the app name and permissions. Make sure to enable read and write access to the necessary resources for seamless integration.

5. After creating the private app, Shopify will generate an API key and API secret key. Keep these keys handy as you'll need them in the next steps.

### _5.3 Configuring Next.js to Connect with Shopify Headless CMS_

Now that you have a Next.js project and a Shopify Headless CMS account, it's time to configure Next.js to connect with Shopify. Follow these steps:

```bash
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-shopify-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-shopify-storefront-access-token
```

Replace `your-shopify-store.myshopify.com` with your actual Shopify store domain, and `your-shopify-storefront-access-token` with the access token you obtained from Shopify.

3. Save the `.env.local` file.

### _5.4 Fetching and Displaying Content from Shopify Headless CMS in Next.js_

Now comes the fun part – fetching and displaying content from Shopify Headless CMS in your Next.js project. Here's how you can do it:

1. Inside your Next.js project, create a new folder called `lib` if it doesn't already exist.

2. Inside the `lib` folder, create a new file called `shopify.js`.

3. In the `shopify.js` file, add the following code to fetch and display content from Shopify:

```javascript
import { GraphQLClient } from "graphql-request";

export async function fetchProducts() {
  const graphQLClient = new GraphQLClient(
    process.env.SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN + "/api/2021-04/graphql.json",
    {
      headers: {
        "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token":
          process.env.SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN,
      },
    }
  );

  const query = /* GraphQL */ `
    {
      products(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            description
            priceRange {
              maxVariantPrice {
                amount
                currencyCode
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  const data = await graphQLClient.request(query);

  return data.products.edges;
}
```

4. Now, you can import the `fetchProducts` function in your Next.js pages and use it to fetch data from Shopify. For example, in your `pages/index.js` file:

```javascript
import { fetchProducts } from '../lib/shopify';

export default function Home({ products }) {
return (

Welcome to my Next.js + Shopify Headless CMS integration!

{products.map((product) => (
{product.node.title}

{product.node.description}

Price: {product.node.priceRange.maxVariantPrice.amount} {product.node.priceRange.maxVariantPrice.currencyCode}
))}
);
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
const products = await fetchProducts();

return {
props: {
products,

};
}
```

That's it! You've successfully integrated Next.js with Shopify Headless CMS and fetched content to display in your Next.js project.
